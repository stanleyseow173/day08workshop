I have been a software engineer for more than 20 years. It is a boring yet also interesting job. Sometimes, I feel like quitting. At times, I will totally stop coding physically. However, in my dreams, I always dream about being a great software developer. Software development methodology is important. We all used to do traditional SDLC. But now we all do software using agile or SCRUM practice.
